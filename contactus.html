					<h3>Ari Harris</h3>
					<p>
						The newest addition to the Taylor Craftworks family is Ari, a passionate
						<strong>metal</strong> artisan. They were initially inspired after seeing their father,
						a former student of George Taylor, create different sculptures at home. Currently, they
						most enjoy making sculptures of people.

					<h3>Tony Hawk</h3>
					<p>
						A California native, Tony moved to the area in 2013 to get a change of pace and scenery.
						He is a master of <strong>glass</strong>, being able to create small and intricate
						trinkets. He can also create magnificently large sculptures, but after time he now
						prefers to make cups and bowls and other practical (but beautiful) items.

			<h2>Crafting Process</h2>
			<p>
				At Taylor Craftworks, we offer different workshops and materials for a wide variety of
				crafts and artisans. The main crafts we've focused on are traditional woodworking,
				metalworking, and glassblowing.
			</p>
			<p>
				For woodworking, our artisans use locally sourced lumber and typically create their products
				using traditional hand tools. When it comes to metalworking, we stick to many practices used
				long ago such as hammering, inlaying, and wiredrawing. To decorate these works, we also
				collaborate with local gemologists and other material sourcers. As for glasswork, our
				artists still use traditional techniques such as by staining glass and making the glass
				itself using materials like sand, soda, and lime.
