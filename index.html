			<h2>About Us</h2>
			<p>
				Starting from humble beginnings, Taylor Craftworks was formed by Gracie and George Taylor in
				1976. They were amazing teachers of woodworking and metalsmithing respectively and spent
				many years guiding students at the
				<a href="https://www.haystack-mtn.org/" target="_blank"
					>Haystack Mountain School of Crafts</a
				>
				before settling in the heart of Camden, Maine. Since then, many of their former students and
				local artisans have joined the Taylor Craftworks family to sell and showcase their
				handcrafted goods and other products, keeping the Taylor's love for different, traditional,
				and unique craftsmanships alive.

						Gracie, who was an avid bird lover. Anna skillfully shaped local birch and maple
						together to make this little fellow, which she fondly named "Waldo."
